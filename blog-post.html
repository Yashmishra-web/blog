          I love wandering through the streets of Mumbai, finding new places popping up at every corner. Mumbai is a place where one can really stay up all night to enjoy the buffet of options when it comes to nightlife. The nights are so radiant that Mumbai is indeed a city that never sleeps :
        </p>
        <blockquote>Mumbai is the city of my dreams: Mumbai formerly known as Bombay, the capital city of Maharashtra. It’s full of dreamers and hard-workers, starlets and gangsters, stray dogs and exotic birds, artists and servants, fisher folk and millionaires and lots of lots people, Mumbai has India’s largest film industry, some of Asia’s biggest slum as well as the world’s most expensive houses.</blockquote>

          Now teaching at <em>Galgotias University</em> I spents my days at the university, but the night is when I truly come alive. Walking through the city on the verge of light and shadow, I discover the most <strong>astonishing, ugly, beautiful places</strong>. Many people are questioning my love for Mumbai's imperfections, but as in the art of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi">Wabi-sabi</a>, true beauty often lies beneath the surface.

            The happening nightlife is a big reason for tourists to visit this city. At any time of the night Mumbai will always be shining with lights, the streets and night clubs teeming with people. Not only tourists even Mumbaikars go out to enjoy the vibrant night life at places like Bandra, Marine drive, Gate Way of India and other places.
          I hope that more and more people will see the true beauty of Mumbai soon. It is a captivating beast that you won't be able to take your eyes of again. Explore the city in your own pace and <u>discover things you have never seen before</u>.
